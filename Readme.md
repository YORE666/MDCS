# MDCSï¼šA multi-distance co-selection evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization.  

## Overview

MDCS uses a two-archive co-evolutionary framework for co-selection. To enhance the convergence pressure of the algorithm, MDCS designs a dual-distance convergence indicator for convergent archive (CA) selection. To comprehensively maintain the global diversity of the population and the local diversity among individuals, MDCS designed a dual diversity maintenance mechanism for diversity archive (DA) selection.

## Project Status

- **Under Review**: The research paper titled "A multi-distance co-selection evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization." is currently under submission for peer review.
- **Ongoing Development**: This repository will be regularly updated with code, documentation, and other resources as the project progresses.

## Disclaimer

The source code and specific methodologies of "MDCS" are currently withheld due to the innovative and confidential nature of the ongoing research. Full disclosure, including the public release of the code, will be considered following the completion of the review process and the paper's potential publication.

## How to run

All code and testing issues run on the PlatEMO platform  ([BIMK/PlatEMO: Evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO))
